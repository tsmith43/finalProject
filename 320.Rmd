Required Tools:



1. Getting Started
  We need to first download the dataset that we are planning to analyze. You can find this dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks/version/7 
  Filter out the reported part of the message. If it doesn't fit the format DAY-MONTH-YEAR we don't care about it and it is deleted from our information. 
  
  Remember to replace all of the blank data point with NA 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

shark_data <- read.csv(file="/Users/trevorsmith/Desktop/attacks.csv", na.strings=c("","NA"))

aus_shark_data <- shark_data %>% 
  filter(Country == "AUSTRALIA") %>%
  separate(Date, into=c("Day","Month"),  "-") %>%
  filter(Month == "Jan" | Month == "Feb" | Month == "Mar" | Month == "Apr" | Month == "May" | Month == "Jun" | Month == "Jul" | Month == "Aug" | Month == "Sep"
         | Month == "Oct" | Month == "Nov" | Month == "Dec") %>% 
  select(Month, Year, Type, Area, Activity, Injury, Fatal = Fatal..Y.N.)
  
aus_shark_data

```
  
  
  Month vs #Attacks
  Activity vs #Attacks
  Ml: Predict number of attacks in a month
  HT: Does month impact # of attacks
